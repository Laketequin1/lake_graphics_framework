create scene(s) [Hirachy of cameras and objects - E.g. Main Menu, Level 1, Level 2] [MUST allow for interpolation]
create window(s)

create camera.perspective(fov, aspect, near, far) [Not in scene. Seperate, so same camera can be used over multiple scenes] [Default shader] [Interpolation settings, or snap]
create shader
camera.apply_shader(shader) [Can be reverted with camera.default_shader()]

geometry = BoxGeometry((1, 1, 1))     <-     inherit from BaseObject3D
material = MeshBasicMaterial({"color": (200, 150, 150)})
cube = Object(Mesh(geometry, material))
cube.move_to((1, 0, 0)) [Moves cube relative to default position. All transformations must be rememebered for children]
scene.add(cube) [Cube 1 unit above origin. Also give the cube a UUID - Possibly important for later!]
cube.move((2, 0, 0)) [Different to move_to]

object = EmptyObject()
scene.add(object) [Same as cube, but no mesh - however things can be added under it as children, where moving the object moves the children]

geometry = SphereGeometry( some settings )
sphere = Object(Mesh(geometry, material)) [Re-using and sharing material from eariler]
sphere.set_name("Boo!")
sphere.set_interpolation_method(None) [Don't interpolate for this sphere only]
cube.add(sphere) [child of cube, inherit transformations, past and future. Add option instead lock pos/rotation in world axis. By default adds sphere to center of parent.]
sphere.move((1, 0, 0)) [Moves cube relative parent cube]

material.set_color((100, 100, 100)) [Update color for both cube and sphere]

sphere.get_parent().move((1, 0, 0)) [Move cube, and thus sphere]
cube.get_children()[0].get_name() -> Gets "Boo!" from the object

cube.hide() [Hide self and children from scene]
cube.show() [Show self and children from scene]
cube.hide_children() [Hide children from scene]
cube.show_children() [Show children from scene]
cube.hide_self() [Hide self from scene, keep children unchanged]
cube.hide_self() [Show self from scene, keep children unchanged]
cube.delete() [Delete self and children from scene]

camera.look_at(object)

window.set_viewport(0, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH / 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT) ?????
window.set_clear_color(color)
window.clear([color optional])
window.render(scene, camera)
window.render(scene2, camera2) [Could have "transparent" background - such as for UI such that scene2 UI appears over scene]
window.update() [Better naming conventions?]
